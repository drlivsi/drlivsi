### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a software developer with a solid background in C# backend development.

When I'm not working on professional projects, you may find that I'm passionate about creating pet-projects - some just for fun, others with a hint of profit. Almost all of these projects are in private repositories and I canâ€™t show the code. Instead, I will show anonymous statistics for my best project âš¡.
